Breadcrumbs is a simple plugin that adds a `breadcrumbs` object to controllers
and views.

## Instalation

Just run `gem install breadcrumbs`. Or add `gem "breadcrumbs"` to your Gemfile.

## Usage

On your controller (optional):

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :add_initial_breadcrumbs

  private
  def add_initial_breadcrumbs
    breadcrumbs.add "Home", root_path
  end
end

class ThingsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    breadcrumbs.add "Things", things_path
  end
end
```

You don't need to provide an URL; in that case, a span will be generated instead
of a link:

```ruby
breadcrumbs.add "Some page"
```

You can set additional HTML attributes if you need to:

```ruby
breadcrumbs.add "Home", root_path, id: "home", title: "Go to the home page"
```

On your view (possibly application.html.erb):

```erb
<%= breadcrumbs.render %>
```

You can render as ordered list.

```erb
<%= breadcrumbs.render(format: :ordered_list) %>
```

You can render as inline links.

```erb
<%= breadcrumbs.render(format: :inline) %>
```

You can set your own separator:

```erb
<p>
  You are here: <%= breadcrumbs.render(format: :inline, separator: "|") %>
</p>
```

You can also define your own formatter. Just create a class that implements a
`render` instance method and you're good to go.

```ruby
class Breadcrumbs::Render::Dl
  def render
    # return breadcrumbs wrapped in a <dl> tag
  end
end
```

To use your new format, just provide the `:format` option.

```ruby
breadcrumbs.render(format: :dl)
```

### I18n

Breadcrumbs is integrated with I18n. You can set translations like:

```yaml
en:
  breadcrumbs:
    home: "Home"
```

And then you just call

```ruby
breadcrumbs.add :home
```

In fact, you can provide any scope you want.

```ruby
breadcrumbs.add :"titles.home"
```

If you don't want to translate a label, just pass the option `:i18n` as `false`.

```ruby
breadcrumbs.add :home, nil, i18n: false
```
